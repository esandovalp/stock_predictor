## 3. Data Flow Explanation

Walk through the full data flow with a specific example:

1. **Data Collection (Every 60 seconds)**
   - Data collector fetches current price, high, low, open, previous close from Finnhub API
   - Example data point: `{"c": 212.33, "h": 213.94, "l": 210.58, "o": 212.43, "pc": 212.93}`
   - Data is timestamped and formatted into a structured record
   - Record is published to Kafka topic `stock-data`
   - Raw data is saved to `/app/data/raw/AAPL_stock_data.csv`

2. **Model Training (Triggered when sufficient data available)**
   - Model trainer consumes data from Kafka topic
   - Features are extracted and normalized
   - When 30+ data points are available, model training begins
   - Linear regression model is trained on 80% of data
   - Model is evaluated on remaining 20% test data
   - Performance metrics (MSE, R²) are calculated and saved
   - Trained model is serialized to disk for future use

3. **Prediction Generation**
   - New stock data is fed into the trained model
   - Model predicts price movement direction and magnitude
   - Prediction is combined with current price to generate a recommendation
   - Results are persisted for historical comparison

4. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Dashboard reads latest data and predictions at regular intervals
   - Data is transformed into interactive visualizations
   - Trading recommendations are generated and displayed
   - System status and market conditions are indicated
